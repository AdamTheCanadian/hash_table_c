# Hash table in c

This is my implementation of a hash table, following the tutorial https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table.

I knew the concept of a hash table but never implemented one. 

I wanted to implement it in C (hence why I followed the tutorial) to a) practice my c skills, and b) I find in C I understand more what is actually happening (for example allocating memory, freeing space, debugging, etc.)

CMakeLists.txt provided if anyone uses cmake.

## Notes/Recommendation

For anyone who comes across this, and follows along with the tutorial, a few pieces of advice:

1. The tutorial link does not actually have a full implementation, just code segements. As such there is variable name changes, or missing pieces. If you look at my git commits (https://github.com/AdamTheCanadian/hash_table_c/commits/master) they explain each difference, and comments are also provided in the code.
2. The authors implementation which is not 100% the same as the tutorials can be found at: https://github.com/jamesroutley/algorithms-and-data-structures/blob/master/hash-table/src/hash_table.h and https://github.com/jamesroutley/algorithms-and-data-structures/blob/master/hash-table/src/hash_table.c
